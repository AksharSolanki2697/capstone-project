# Predicting Tags for StackOverflow Questions

## Summary

Stack Overflow is a community based Q&A website and is the largest online community for programmers to learn, share their knowledge, and advance their careers. It has been the single source of truth to answer programming questions for even the best of programmers. Along with having an active community that eagerly helps in providing answers to new questions, the sheer volume of of those questions asked is so large that it is impossible to prevent duplicate questions. Therefore, StackOverflow has come up with multiple solutions to prevent question replication. One of the solutions is to have a downvote button and another one of the solutions is to "TAG" the questions so that community members can search for the appropriate questions before having to ask the same question again. It does this using multiple methods like Text Processing, Neural Networks and various Machine Learning algorithms. This project is an humble effort to duplicate the "TAG" feature for StackOverflow questions.  


## Data Explanation

This data was sourced from Kaggle Dataset with the text of 10% of questions and answers from the Stack Overflow programming Q&A website.

This is organized as three tables:

Questions contains the title, body, creation date, closed date (if applicable), score, and owner ID for all non-deleted Stack Overflow questions whose Id is a multiple of 10.

Tags contains the tags on each of these questions
